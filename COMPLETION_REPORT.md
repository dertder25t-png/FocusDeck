## 🎯 Try These First

1. **Pin a Window**
   - Hover dock, click any window
   - It turns green = pinned
   - Close the window and app
   - Relaunch app - pin persists! ✅

2. **Park Today**
   - Arrange some windows
   - Workspace → Park Today
   - Close the app
   - Relaunch - workspace auto-restored! ✅

3. **Set Automation**
   - Automations → Add Example Rule
   - Set Mon-Fri, 9:00-17:00
   - When time matches, you get a 2-second preview
   - Click Undo or wait to apply

4. **Change Dock Edge**
   - Dock → Edge → Select Bottom
   - Dock moves to bottom edge
   - Settings auto-saved

---

## 🏗️ Clean Architecture

```
FocusDock.System (Windows P/Invoke)
        ↓
FocusDock.Data (JSON Persistence)  
        ↓
FocusDock.Core (Business Logic)
        ↓
FocusDock.App (WPF UI)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Easy to test each layer independently
- ✅ Easy to swap implementations
- ✅ Easy to add new features
- ✅ Zero circular dependencies

---

## 💾 Where Data Lives

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\FocusDock\
├── settings.json       (dock position & config)
├── presets.json        (layout presets you save)
├── workspaces.json     (saved window arrangements)
├── pins.json           (pinned window records)
└── automation.json     (time-based rules)
```

All files use JSON - safe to manually edit for advanced config!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Compilation | 24 errors ❌ | 0 errors ✅ |
| Circular deps | Many | None ✅ |
| Pin storage | Not saved | Auto-saved ✅ |
| Workspace restore | Manual | Auto ✅ |
| Code quality | Ambiguous types | Clean ✅ |
| Documentation | None | Comprehensive ✅ |

## 📦 What's Included

### Code
- 4 projects (System, Data, Core, App)
- ~1,500 lines of source code
- ~150 lines of XAML UI
- All builds & runs

### Documentation  
- User guide (QUICKSTART.md)
- Developer guide (DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Architecture docs
- Status report

### Data
- All user data persisted as JSON
- Auto-loaded on app start
- Manually editable for power users

---

## 🎓 Architecture Highlights

### Layered Design
Each layer has a single responsibility:

**System Layer**
- Win32 P/Invoke declarations
- Window enumeration (WindowTracker)
- Session monitoring infrastructure

**Data Layer**
- Model definitions (LayoutPreset, Workspace, etc.)
- JSON persistence (PresetService, WorkspaceStore, etc.)
- No business logic

**Core Layer**
- LayoutManager (applies zones to windows)
- PinService (tracks pinned windows)
- WorkspaceManager (capture/restore)
- AutomationService (evaluate rules)
- ReminderService (detect stale windows)

**App Layer**
- MainWindow (dock UI + menus)
- DockViewModel (MVVM binding)
- Ties everything together

### Event-Driven
Services communicate via events:
- `PinService.PinsChanged` → UI updates
- `AutomationService.RuleTriggered` → Show preview
- `WindowTracker.WindowsUpdated` → Refresh groups

---

## 🚀 Next Phase (Calendar Integration)

To add calendar support:

1. **Get Google Calendar API key** (1 day setup)
2. **Add CalendarService** in Core layer (1 day)
3. **Parse Canvas assignments** (1 day)
4. **Add class-time automations** (2 days)

Would add most value for student workflows!

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Multiple Workspaces**
   - Save workspace "Study Mode"
   - Save workspace "Work Layout"  
   - Restore different ones as needed

2. **Automation Chains**
   - 9:00 AM → Load Study Layout
   - 5:00 PM → Close stale windows
   - 6:00 PM → Enable Focus Mode

3. **Direct JSON Editing**
   - Edit `automation.json` directly for power rules
   - Add custom times/triggers not in UI

4. **Multi-Monitor**
   - Layouts apply per monitor
   - Dock can be on any edge of any monitor

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Windows must be running** - Workspace restore only re-pins existing windows
2. **Single restoration** - Only "Park Today" auto-restores
3. **SessionMonitor** - Lock detection infrastructure ready but not wired up yet
4. **UI Polish** - Vertical dock works but could use animations
