### Potential Revenue Streams
1. **Freemium Model**
   - Free: Desktop app, basic analytics
   - Pro ($5/mo): Cloud sync, mobile app, advanced analytics
   - Team ($15/mo): Study groups, leaderboards, group analytics

2. **One-Time Purchase**
   - $20 one-time for mobile app + desktop features

3. **Sponsorships**
   - Partner with focus music services (Spotify, YouTube Music)
   - School/University licenses

4. **B2B (Schools)**
   - License to universities for class/study tracking

---

## Conclusion

FocusDeck's foundation (Phases 1-4) positions it perfectly for expansion. The next phases focus on:

1. **Depth**: Making study more effective (AI, voice notes, spaced repetition)
2. **Breadth**: Reaching more platforms (mobile, cloud)
3. **Community**: Building social aspects (groups, competitions)
4. **Integration**: Connecting with ecosystem (Google, Canvas, Microsoft)

Each phase is independently valuable - you can implement them in any order based on user feedback and priorities.

**Recommended Next Move**: Start with Phase 5a (Voice Notes) as it's relatively low-risk, high-value, and uses only free/built-in APIs.
