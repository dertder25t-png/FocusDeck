# FocusDeck Self-Hosted Cloud Sync - User Setup Guide

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**For Users Who Want:** Windows + Android sync with their own server

---

## Overview

FocusDeck lets you sync your study sessions across devices in **two ways**:

### Option A: Local Only (No Setup) ‚úÖ
- **Windows Desktop:** Works offline, saves to local database
- **Android Mobile:** Works offline, saves to local database
- Sessions **don't sync** between devices
- Perfect if you just use one device

### Option B: Self-Hosted Cloud Sync (This Guide) üöÄ
- **Windows Desktop:** Works offline + syncs to your server
- **Android Mobile:** Works offline + syncs to your server
- Sessions **sync between all devices** automatically
- You control the server (privacy)
- Simple one-command setup

---

## Option B: Self-Hosted Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Get a Linux Server

You need **any** Linux server you can run commands on:

**Options:**
- **Cloud Providers (Easiest):**
  - DigitalOcean ($5-8/month VPS)
  - Linode ($5/month)
  - AWS EC2 Free Tier (1 year free)
  - Google Cloud Always Free

- **At Home:**
  - Raspberry Pi 4+ (sitting in a closet)
  - Old laptop running Ubuntu
  - Proxmox VM
  - Any Linux computer

**Requirements:**
- Ubuntu 20.04 or newer (or any systemd-based Linux)
- 1 GB RAM minimum (really 512 MB OK)
- 10 GB disk space (50 MB for database)
- Network access (port 443 open)

**Recommended:** DigitalOcean Basic Droplet ($5/month) - takes 2 minutes to set up

---

### Step 2: One-Command Server Deployment

SSH into your Linux server and run:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dertder25t-png/FocusDeck/master/scripts/setup-pocketbase-simple.sh | sudo bash
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Automatically downloads and installs PocketBase
2. ‚úÖ Sets up HTTPS with free SSL certificate
3. ‚úÖ Configures automatic startup
4. ‚úÖ Creates reverse proxy (Nginx)
5. ‚úÖ Shows you your server URL

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Knowledge needed:** Copy/paste into terminal

---

### Step 3: Complete (Your Server is Ready!)

The script tells you:
```
‚úÖ SETUP COMPLETE!

Admin Dashboard: https://YOUR_SERVER_IP/_/

Next steps:

## That's It! You're Done! üéâ

- ‚úÖ Sync between devices automatically
- ‚úÖ Keep your data private (you control the server)

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Is my data private?
**A:** Yes! Your server is yours. No data goes to cloud companies. You control everything.

### Q: What if my server goes down?
**A:** Your apps still work offline. Sessions save locally. When server is back up, they auto-sync.

### Q: Can I change my admin password?
**A:** Yes! Visit `https://YOUR_SERVER_IP/_/` and change it in Settings.

### Q: What if I forget my password?
**A:** SSH into your server and run:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart pocketbase
# Then re-run the setup script to create a new admin
```

### Q: Can multiple people use the same server?
**A:** Currently: No (each person gets their own admin account on the shared server).  
Coming soon: Multi-user support where you can invite friends/family.

### Q: How much does this cost?
**A:** 
- DigitalOcean: $5/month
- Linode: $5/month
- Home server (Raspberry Pi): $50-100 one-time
- AWS Free Tier: FREE for 1 year

### Q: Do I need to do anything to maintain it?
**A:** Nope! It auto-updates. You can check health with:
```bash
sudo systemctl status pocketbase
```

### Q: Can I access my server from anywhere?
**A:** Yes! As long as it has a public IP or you set up port forwarding.

### Q: What if I'm not technical?
**A:** Don't worry! The setup is literally one line of code. The hardest part is:
1. Getting a VPS ($5/month)
2. Copy/pasting one command
3. Creating a password

That's it. No Docker, no coding, no complexity.

## Troubleshooting

### Server shows as "Not Responding"

**Check 1:** Is the server running?
```bash
sudo systemctl status pocketbase
```

**Check 2:** Can you reach it?
```bash
curl https://YOUR_SERVER_IP/api/health
```

**Check 3:** Check logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u pocketbase -n 20
```

### Sync not working on phone

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Server URL is correct (with `https://`)
3. Check credentials are correct
4. Try "Test Connection" button

### Sessions not appearing on other device

- Give it 10 seconds (it might still be syncing)
- Restart the app
- Check server is reachable

### SSL Certificate Warnings

This is normal on first setup. The cert is self-signed but secure. Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Accept" in your browser.

(Coming soon: automatic Let's Encrypt setup for proper certificates)
