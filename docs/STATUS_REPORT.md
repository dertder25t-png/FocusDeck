## 🎉 THIS SESSION'S DELIVERABLES

### 1️⃣ GitHub Release Infrastructure ✅

**GitHub Actions Workflows**:
```
.github/workflows/
├── build-desktop.yml   (Windows automated build)
└── build-mobile.yml    (Android automated build)
```

**How It Works**:
```
Developer runs: git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
                           ↓
GitHub Actions triggers automatically
                           ↓
✅ Desktop built: FocusDeck-Desktop-v1.0.0.zip
✅ Mobile built:  FocusDeck-Mobile-v1.0.0.apk
                           ↓
GitHub Release created with both artifacts
                           ↓
Users can download from: github.com/dertder25t-png/FocusDeck/releases
```

**Release Triggers**:
- ✅ Manual: `git tag v*.*.* && git push`
- ✅ Automatic: On tag matching `v*`
- ✅ Test: Push to master (creates artifacts, no release)

---

### 2️⃣ Linux Server Automation ✅

**File**: `setup-server.sh` (579 lines, fully commented)

**One-Line Deployment**:
```bash
sudo bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dertder25t-png/FocusDeck/master/setup-server.sh)
```

**Automated Setup**:
- ✅ OS detection (Ubuntu/Debian/Linux)
- ✅ .NET 8 runtime installation
- ✅ Application user & directories
- ✅ Nginx reverse proxy (HTTP → HTTPS)
- ✅ SSL certificate generation
- ✅ Systemd service
- ✅ Logging setup
- ✅ Post-install instructions

**Result**: Production-ready server in ~5 minutes

```

**NOT PLANNED**:
```
❌ iOS (No Apple ecosystem support)
❌ macOS (No Apple ecosystem support)

## 🎓 Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture
1. **Desktop**: Windows-only WPF (cannot be cross-platform - uses Win32 APIs)
2. **Mobile**: Android-only MAUI (iOS not planned; can be added without breaking changes)
3. **Server**: Linux .NET 8 (portable across distributions)
4. **Services**: Platform-specific implementations with shared interfaces

### Build System
1. **Desktop**: Self-contained ZIP (portable, no installer)
2. **Mobile**: Direct APK distribution (future: Google Play Store)
3. **Server**: Automated setup script (Proxmox-optimized)
4. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (free tier sufficient)

### Platform Support
1. **Actively Developed**: Windows + Android + Linux
2. **Not Planned**: iOS/macOS (different platform requirements)
3. **Future**: Web UI as separate project (if needed)

## 📅 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 2)
- Begin Phase 6b Week 2: Study Timer Page
- Implement 8 tasks over ~14 hours
- Target: Fully functional timer with session persistence
- Expected completion: Start of following week

### Following Weeks
- **Week 3**: Database schema + offline-first sync queue
- **Week 4**: OAuth2 cloud storage integration
- **Week 5**: History, Analytics, Settings pages + app release

### Future Phases
- **Phase 7**: Performance optimization
- **Phase 8**: AI-powered recommendations
- **Phase 9**: Advanced analytics & reports
