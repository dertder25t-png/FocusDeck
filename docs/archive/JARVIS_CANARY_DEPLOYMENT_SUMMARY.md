# JARVIS Canary Deployment - Summary

**Date**: November 14, 2025  
**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKED - Infrastructure Provisioning Required  
**Canary Tenant**: FD86A760-06C6-4310-BEBB-4B2DC33295C6 (dertder25t@gmail.com)

---

## ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED

**Current State**: Code deployed but running on SQLite (development database)  
**Blocker**: PostgreSQL infrastructure not provisioned  
**Required Actions**: See `JARVIS_INFRASTRUCTURE_BLOCKERS.md`

### Critical Blockers
1. ❌ PostgreSQL databases (`focusdeck`, `focusdeck_jobs`) not provisioned
2. ❌ Environment variables for PostgreSQL not configured
3. ❌ Database migrations not applied to PostgreSQL
4. ❌ E2E validation not completed
5. ❌ 24-hour monitoring campaign not started

**Action Required**: Operations must complete infrastructure provisioning before canary testing can proceed.

**See**: `JARVIS_INFRASTRUCTURE_BLOCKERS.md` for complete checklist and setup instructions.

## What Was Deployed

### 1. Feature Flag Enabled
- **Configuration**: `Features:Jarvis: true` in `appsettings.Production.json`
- **Server Build**: Rebuilt and deployed at 17:43 UTC Nov 14, 2025
- **Migration Applied**: `20251114061155_AddJarvisAndActivitySignals`
  - Created `JarvisWorkflowRuns` table
  - Created `ActivitySignals` table
  - Added indexes for performance

### 2. Available Endpoints
All endpoints require authentication (JWT token):

| Endpoint | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `GET /v1/jarvis/workflows` | ✅ Live | List available workflows |
| `POST /v1/jarvis/run-workflow` | ✅ Live | Enqueue workflow execution |
| `GET /v1/jarvis/runs/{id}` | ✅ Live | Check run status |
| `POST /v1/activity/signals` | ✅ Live | Submit activity signals |

### 3. Testing Tools Created
- **`/tmp/test_jarvis_endpoints.sh`**: Quick endpoint validation script
- **`/tmp/jarvis_signal_emitter.sh`**: Continuous activity signal generator
- **`JARVIS_CANARY_OPS_GUIDE.md`**: Complete ops/monitoring documentation

---

## Quick Start Testing

### Step 1: Get Authentication Token
Login via the UI at `https://focusdeckv1.909436.xyz` and extract the JWT token from browser storage.

### Step 2: Test Endpoints
```bash
# Run endpoint tests
/tmp/test_jarvis_endpoints.sh YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Step 3: Generate Activity Signals
```bash
# Start signal emitter (sends signals every 10 seconds)
/tmp/jarvis_signal_emitter.sh YOUR_TOKEN_HERE 10

# Expected output:
# [17:45:23] ✅ window_focus: Visual Studio Code
# [17:45:33] ✅ keyboard_activity: 67
# [17:45:43] ✅ mouse_activity: active
```

### Step 4: Run a Workflow
```bash
curl -X POST https://focusdeckv1.909436.xyz/v1/jarvis/run-workflow \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"WorkflowId": "test-workflow", "Parameters": {}}'
```

### Step 5: Monitor Activity
```bash
# Watch Jarvis logs
journalctl -u focusdeck -f | grep -i jarvis

# Check database activity
sqlite3 /home/focusdeck/FocusDeck/publish/data/focusdeck.db \
  "SELECT * FROM ActivitySignals ORDER BY CapturedAtUtc DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## What to Monitor

### Performance Metrics
- **Workflow API Latency**: Target <200ms
- **Signal Ingestion Rate**: Target <50ms per signal
- **HTTP 429 Rate**: Target <1% (rate limiting working)
- **Database Write Latency**: Target <10ms
- **Memory Usage**: Baseline ~100MB, monitor for leaks
- **CPU Usage**: Target <10% idle, <50% under load

### Key Logs to Watch
```bash
# Workflow runs
journalctl -u focusdeck -f | grep "Jarvis run requested"

# Activity signals
journalctl -u focusdeck -f | grep "Activity signal captured"

# Rate limiting
journalctl -u focusdeck -f | grep "Run limit exceeded"

# Errors
journalctl -u focusdeck -f | grep -i "error\|exception" | grep -i "jarvis"
```

### Database Queries
```bash
# Count signals by type
sqlite3 /home/focusdeck/FocusDeck/publish/data/focusdeck.db \
  "SELECT SignalType, COUNT(*) FROM ActivitySignals GROUP BY SignalType;"

# Recent workflow runs
sqlite3 /home/focusdeck/FocusDeck/publish/data/focusdeck.db \
  "SELECT WorkflowId, Status, datetime(EnqueuedAtUtc) FROM JarvisWorkflowRuns ORDER BY EnqueuedAtUtc DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## Next Steps (After 24-48 Hours)

### Data Collection Goals
- [ ] 100+ workflow runs completed
- [ ] 1,000+ activity signals ingested
- [ ] Performance metrics collected
- [ ] UX feedback documented

### Analysis Questions
1. **Performance**: Are latency targets being met?
2. **Reliability**: What's the error rate?
3. **Rate Limiting**: Are 429s occurring? At what frequency?
4. **Metadata**: Is current signal metadata sufficient?
5. **Activity Classification**: Should we add automatic categorization?

### Improvement Priorities
Based on canary feedback, prioritize:
- **Richer Metadata**: Add more context to activity signals
- **Activity Classification**: Auto-detect "coding" vs "research" vs "communication"
- **Workflow Discovery**: Improve workflow listing/documentation
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize database queries/indexes
- **Rate Limiting**: Adjust thresholds based on actual usage
