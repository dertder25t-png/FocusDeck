- Use User Secrets for development
- See `docs/API_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` for details

### 📅 Timeline
- Each week is 40 hours (8 hrs/day, 5 days)
- Follow checklist exactly - weeks build on each other
- Don't skip ahead - foundational work needed first

### 📚 Documentation
- All guides have code examples
- Architecture is clear and documented
- Troubleshooting sections included
- References to existing code provided

### 💡 Development Philosophy
- Use MVVM pattern (described in MAUI_ARCHITECTURE.md)
