## 🚀 Next Steps (in order)

### Step 1: Read Navigation Guide (5 min)
```bash
# Open and read:
cat docs/INDEX.md
```

### Step 2: Read Phase 6b Implementation Guide (15 min)
```bash
# This is your week-by-week checklist:
cat docs/PHASE6b_IMPLEMENTATION.md
```

### Step 3: Set Up API Credentials (10-15 min)
```bash
# Choose ONE (OneDrive recommended):

```

### Step 4: Begin Phase 6b Week 1
```bash
# Execute checklist from docs/PHASE6b_IMPLEMENTATION.md:

# Task 1: Create MAUI project
dotnet new maui -n FocusDeck.Mobile -o src/FocusDeck.Mobile

# Task 2: Add to solution
cd src/FocusDeck.Mobile
dotnet sln ../../FocusDeck.sln add FocusDeck.Mobile.csproj

# Task 3: Update project file with dependencies
# (See docs/PHASE6b_IMPLEMENTATION.md Week 1, Task 2)

# Task 4: Create DI configuration
# (See docs/PHASE6b_IMPLEMENTATION.md Week 1, Task 3)
