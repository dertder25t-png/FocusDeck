## ✨ What's New in This Version

### Pin Persistence ✅
```
Before: Pin a window → Close app → Pin is lost ❌
After:  Pin a window → Close app → Pin persists ✅
```
Pins auto-saved to `pins.json` on every toggle

### Workspace Auto-Restore ✅
```
Before: Save workspace → Close app → Manual restore ❌
After:  Save workspace → Close app → Auto-restores ✅
```
App automatically restores "Park Today" workspace on launch

### Park Today Feature ✅
```
One-click "Park Today" in Workspace menu
→ Saves current windows + layout as "Park Today" workspace
→ Auto-restores tomorrow when you launch the app
Perfect for end-of-day workflow!
```

### Architecture Improvements ✅
```
Before: 24 build errors, circular dependencies ❌
After:  0 errors, clean dependency flow ✅
```

## 🎯 Key Features Walkthrough

### 1. Pin Windows
```
1. Hover dock to expand
2. Click any window → turns green
3. Pinned windows persist across sessions
4. Window closes but pin remains
5. Next session: re-pin when window opens again
```

### 2. Save Workspace
```
1. Arrange windows how you want
2. Pin the ones you want remembered
3. Workspace → Save Workspace As...
4. Name it (e.g., "Study Mode")
5. Later: Workspace → Restore: Study Mode
```

### 3. Park Today
```
1. At end of day: Workspace → Park Today
2. Saves current windows + applied layout
3. Tomorrow: App auto-restores everything
4. No manual setup needed!
```

### 4. Apply Layout
```
1. Layouts → Monitor 1 → Two Column
2. Name it when prompted (or skip)
3. Opens windows tile in 2-column layout
4. Save preset for future use
```

### 5. Set Automation
```
1. Automations → Add Example Rule
2. Set: Mon-Fri, 9:00-17:00, Apply "Work Layout"
3. At 9:00 AM on weekday: Gets 2-second preview
4. Click Undo to skip or wait to apply
5. Automation rule persisted to automation.json
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

### Why This Matters
```
Good Architecture = Easy to Fix & Extend
```

### Layer Separation
```
System Layer (Win32)
    ↓
Data Layer (JSON)  
    ↓
Core Layer (Logic)
    ↓
App Layer (UI)
```

Each layer has one job:
- **System**: Talk to Windows
- **Data**: Save/load JSON
- **Core**: Do the work
- **App**: Show the UI

### Result
- ✅ Add new feature: 2-3 files max
- ✅ Change storage: Modify one layer
- ✅ Test logic: No UI needed
- ✅ Reuse code: Easy components

## 📊 Build Results

```
FocusDock.System     ✅ succeeded (0.2s)
FocusDock.Data       ✅ succeeded (0.1s)
FocusDock.Core       ✅ succeeded (0.2s)
FocusDock.App        ✅ succeeded (1.7s)
─────────────────────────────────────
Total: 3.3s          0 errors ✅
```

**Fixed**: 24 errors → 0 errors ✅

## 💾 Data Persistence Explained

### Automatic Saving
```
Every action auto-saves:
- Pin a window        → pins.json updated
- Save workspace      → workspaces.json updated
- Change dock edge    → settings.json updated
- Set automation rule → automation.json updated
- Save layout preset  → presets.json updated
```

### Automatic Loading
```
On app startup:
- Load settings       → Dock positioned correctly
- Load pins.json      → Restore pinned state
- Load "Park Today"   → Auto-restore workspace
- Load automations    → Rules ready to evaluate
```

### Safety
```
All JSON files are human-readable
Safe to manually edit
Safe to backup/restore
Safe to transfer between machines
```

## 🎓 For Developers

### To Add a Feature

1. **Add Model** → `FocusDock.Data/Models/`
2. **Add Storage** → `FocusDock.Data/*.Store.cs`
3. **Add Logic** → `FocusDock.Core/Services/`
4. **Add UI** → `FocusDock.App/MainWindow.xaml(.cs)`
5. **Wire Together** → `FocusDock.App/MainWindow.xaml.cs`

### Example: Add "Snap to Grid" Layout
1. Add `SnapGridPreset` class to `LayoutModels.cs`
2. Add `SaveSnapGrid()` to `PresetService.cs`
3. Add `ApplySnapGrid()` to `LayoutManager.cs`
4. Add menu item in `MainWindow.xaml.cs`
5. Done! Auto-persists via existing flow

### Key Patterns
- Services communicate via **events**
- UI updates via **data binding**
- Data persists via **JSON stores**
- Threading via **Dispatcher**

## 🐛 Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Fix |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Workspace restore only if windows are running | Low | Document in help |
| SessionMonitor not yet wired to automations | Low | Complete in Phase 1.1 |
| Vertical dock could use animations | Low | UI polish task |
| No multi-workspace view | Medium | Phase 2 enhancement |

**Status**: All limitations are non-blocking and documented

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
→ Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FocusDock\` to reset all config

**Pins didn't save?**
→ Restart app, check `pins.json` exists

**Automation didn't fire?**
→ Check time range, days of week, and current time

**Workspace didn't restore?**
→ Make sure windows are already open

**Change stuck on old value?**
→ Delete corresponding JSON file, restart app
