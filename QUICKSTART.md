All data stored in: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FocusDock\`

- `presets.json` - Layout presets

## üéØ Next Phase Features (Not in MVP)

- **Calendar Integration** (Google Calendar, Canvas)
- **To-Do System** (unified task list with automations)
- **Note-Taking** (rich editor, course-based organization)
- **Audio Recording** (lecture capture with timestamps)
- **Flashcards** (spaced repetition study)
- **Study Mode** (immersive workspace for focused learning)
- **Android Companion App** (remote dock control, notifications)
- **Network Detection** (Wi-Fi SSID triggers)
- **Visual Themes** (light/dark modes, customizable colors)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Pin Restore**: Restores pin state but windows must be open
2. **Vertical Dock**: Works but UI could use more polish
3. **SessionMonitor**: Partially implemented (lock/unlock detection ready but not integrated)
4. **Single Focus**: No multi-workspace view switching yet

---

## üìä Build & Test

```powershell
# Build
dotnet build

# Run
dotnet run --project src/FocusDock.App/FocusDock.App.csproj

# Clean
dotnet clean
rm -Recurse src/*/bin,src/*/obj
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: Start with one layout and one workspace
2. **Auto-restore**: App automatically restores "Park Today" on next launch
3. **Undo automations**: Automation preview gives you 2 seconds to undo
4. **No conflicts**: Pinning a window doesn't affect closing/minimizing it
5. **JSON direct edit**: Advanced users can edit JSON files directly (app reloads on restart)
