## ✨ Key Features of Reorganization

### 1. Clean Root Level
```
Only essential docs visible to users:
- README.md (project overview)
- QUICKSTART.md (dev setup)
- API_SETUP_GUIDE.md (API credentials)
- VISION_ROADMAP.md (strategic roadmap)
```

### 2. Implementation Guides in docs/
```
Developers find everything they need:
- INDEX.md (where to find things)
- PHASE6b_IMPLEMENTATION.md (what to build)
- MAUI_ARCHITECTURE.md (how to structure)
- CLOUD_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md (how sync works)
- API_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md (how to auth)
```

### 3. Old Docs Preserved
```
Not deleted, just archived:
- Available in git history
- Referenced in VISION_ROADMAP.md
- Can view with git log
```

### 4. Clear Navigation
```
Every doc points to related docs:
- PHASE6b_READY.md → docs/INDEX.md
- docs/INDEX.md → all other guides
- docs/PHASE6b_IMPLEMENTATION.md → MAUI_ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/API_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md → API_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```
