## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns makes multi-platform support trivial
2. **Dependency Injection**: Essential for testing and flexibility
3. **Encryption Complexity**: AES-256-GCM is powerful but needs careful implementation
4. **Cloud API Abstraction**: Interface-based design lets us swap providers without code changes
5. **Documentation First**: Designing before coding saves massive refactoring later
