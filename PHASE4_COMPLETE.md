## Testing Recommendations

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Start study session and verify timer displays correctly
- [ ] Verify pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Verify break reminder appears at 25 minutes
- [ ] Verify effectiveness rating dialog appears on session end
- [ ] Verify sessions persist to JSON file
- [ ] Verify history window loads and displays all sessions
- [ ] Test date range filtering in history

- [ ] Test with no sessions in history
- [ ] Test with sessions from multiple subjects
- [ ] Export with special characters in subject name
- [ ] Verify date filtering edge cases (same day range, future dates)

### Performance Tests

- [ ] History window should load 100+ sessions quickly
- [ ] Analytics calculations should complete in <1 second
- [ ] CSV export should handle 1000+ sessions

### Visual/UI Tests

- [ ] Dialog positioning relative to owner windows
- [ ] List box scrolling performance

## Architecture Notes

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 8** with WPF
- **DispatcherTimer** for UI-safe interval updates
- **System.Text.Json** for persistence
- **MVVM pattern** with Observable collections
- **Data binding** for real-time UI updates

### Design Patterns
- **ViewModel pattern** for service integration
- **Event-driven** service architecture
- **Dependency injection** via constructor parameters
- **Modal dialogs** for user interactions
- **CSV serialization** for data export

### Performance Optimizations
- Timer runs at 500ms intervals (not 100ms)
- Analytics calculations cache results
- List rendering uses ItemsSource binding
- No excessive object creation in loops

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Analytics only shows last 30 days (not configurable)
- CSV export uses simple serialization (no special character escaping)
- Break reminder is visual banner only (no sound/notification)
- No session notes editing after session ends

### Potential Enhancements
- Add sound notifications for breaks
- Support for break reminders every N minutes (not just 25)
- Edit session data after creation
- Configurable session goal (not fixed at 60 minutes)
- Weekly/monthly analytics views (not just 30-day)
- Export to Excel format (.xlsx) with formatting
- Email analytics reports
- Study session templates/presets
- Goal tracking and achievement badges

## Integration Points

### Dock UI (MainWindow)
- ‚è± button launches study session menu
- Menu shows available plans and quick start option
- "View Session History" accessible from menu

### Study Plan Service (Phase 2)
- Provides available study plans for menu
- Persists session data via EndSession()
- Queries session history via GetSessionLogs()

### Data Persistence
- All sessions saved to %LOCALAPPDATA%\FocusDock\todos.json
- Session logs merged with study plan data
- Full historical data maintained
